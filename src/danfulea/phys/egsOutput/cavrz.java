	//"           where dpmfp_i is MFP to the next interaction for the i-th sub-photon
	//"           eta is a random number (the same for all n_split sub-photons)
	//"         * Once at the interaction site, the i'th sub-photon produces
	//"           electrons and/or scattered photons. Scattered photons are
	//"           killed with probability 1/n_split, so that, if they survive,
	//"           they have the weight of the original photon. Electrons have the
	//"           weight of 1/n_split of original weight.
	//"         * In any radiative events (brems, annih, annih at rest), photons
	//"           are killed with probability 1/n_split => they have again the
	//"           weight of the photon that initiated the history, if they survive
	//"         * If ifano = 1 (regeneration), all scattered photons are killed
	//"           and split-photons re-generated with probability 1/n_split.
	//"         * If the user wants to calculate Awall in addition to the dose
	//"           (ifull=1), at all interaction sites the primary photon is
	//"           regenerated with probability 1/n_split and marked as such
	//"           (latch=2). It's descending electrons then only score to the
	//"           dose with attenuation and scatter removed. The ratio of the
	//"           real dose to the dose with attenuation and scatter removed
	//"           is per definition Awall. Due to the strong correlation between
	//"           the two doses the uncertainty on Awall is much smaller than
	//"           the uncertainty on the each individual dose.
	//"
	//"   BE AWARE: When this option is turned on, the normal scoring arrays
	//"             in cavrznrc are ignored and scoring is done on a history-

	//"                            The algorithm employed is implemented via

	//"                            AUSGAB and works as follows:
	//"       - the photon cross section is multiplied with the enhancement
	//"         factor (say, C).
	//"       - when a photon arrives at an interaction site, it is split into
	//"         an interacting part (fraction 1/C) and a non-interacting part
	//"         (fraction  1-1/C).
	//"       - Electrons set in motion by the interacting fraction are kept
	//"       - Scattered photons and the non-interacting portion of the
	//"         original photon are killed with probabilities 1/C and 1-1/C,
	//"         respectively.
	//"       - Because the goal is to calculate Awall in addition to the real
	//"         cavity dose, killed non-interacting fractions of primary
	//"         photons are left on
	//"         the stack but marked as such so that, when they are transported,
	//"         all their descending alectrons contribute only to the dose
	//"         with attenuation and scatter removed.
	//"       - Scattered photons descending from a 'killed' non-interacting
	//"         fractions are always removed from the stack
	//"       - Because no forcing is done, it is a good idea to set the
	//"         enhancement factor to a big enough number so that
	//"         photons interact several times in the chamber. For instance,
	//"         the attenuation coefficient of a Co60 beam in graphite is ~0.1,
	//"         if the chamber wall thickness is, say, 1 cm, the average
	//"         number of MFP is 0.1. To have on average 5 interactions per
	//"         incident photon one needs C=50 (0.1*50 = 5)
	//"
	//"   BE AWARE: If you select to a big enhancement factor, a stack overflow
	//"             may result. In such cases either use a smaller enhancement
	//"             factor or increase $MXSTACK (currently 2000)
